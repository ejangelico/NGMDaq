/**
 * @file libfx2loader.h
 *
 * The <b>FX2Loader</b> library makes it easier to load and save an FX2LP's RAM and EEPROM firmware.
 * Its functions fall into two categories:
 * - <b>FX2 Operations</b>: Write raw bytes to RAM and read/write raw bytes to/from EEPROM.
 * - <b>I2C Operations</b>: Of course you can write arbitrary data to EEPROM if you like, but the
 * EEPROM is usually used to bootstrap the FX2LP firmware on power-on. To do this you must write
 * bytes in a specific format to EEPROM. This format is described in the <a href="http://www.cypress.com/?rID=38232">TRM section 3.4.3</a>,
 * and you can use these functions to prepare a buffer in the I2C format, or decode a buffer that is
 * already in the I2C format.
